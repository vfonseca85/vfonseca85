My name is Valdir Fonseca and I'm a Software engineer/delevoper.

Since university, I've been passionate about coding, problem solving, challenging and pushing myself everyday ðŸ˜Ž

Recently, I've been taking some online programming courses on LinkedIn and Udemy'a platform, to keep up-to-date with the technologies.

Also, I like to meet new people, working out, watching movies and sometimes just walk through the nature.

Please feel free to reach me out ðŸ¤™
