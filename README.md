My name is Valdir Fonseca and I'm a Software engineer/developer.

Since university, I've been passionate about coding, problem-solving, challenging and pushing myself every dayÂ Â  

Recently, I've been taking some online programming courses on LinkedIn and Udemy platform, to keep up-to-date with the technologies. I have added my projects from the Â University to this profile, and currently working on personal projects

In my free time, just to keep my eyes off the screen for a while, I like to meet new people, work out, watch movies and sometimes just walk through nature.

Please feel free to reach me out ðŸ¤™
